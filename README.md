## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This project implements a fully functional Smart Hospital Patient Management System as part of my CO658 Data Structures & Algorithms coursework.

The system models how hospitals handle patient data, appointments, treatment records, undoable edits, and emergency triage, all while utilizing multiple data structures effectively to optimize performance and flexibility.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Efficient application of **Hash Tables** for patient records
- Use of **Linked Lists** for dynamic treatment history storage
- **Stacks** used for undo functionality in patient editing
- **Queues** used for appointment scheduling (FIFO system)
- Implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to manage triage priorities based on patient severity
